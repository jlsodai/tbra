Using the Myers Briggs tool, one of the world’s oldest and most trusted personality assessments, leaders will gain a deep understanding of their personality at work. At the end of this session, leaders will understand the following:\n - The personality distribution of the leadership team and, therefore, the leadership culture of the organisation\n- Their leadership style\n- How their leadership style responds to change\n- How their leadership style affects delegation & management of tasks\n- The relationship between their personal leadership style and decision making",

However, 85% of leaders need to learn what these values are. At the end of this module, the leaders will: \n- Determine their top 3 values at this stage of their leadership journey\n- Define conscious mindsets and behaviours to anchor their values for practical action in the world\n- Consider the strategy for their leadership journey based on their values and how they align with those of their organisation",

At the end of this module, leaders will:\n- Understand three critical theoretical frames for conflict in the work environment\n- Explore their relationship with conflict and how they participate in conflict\n- Locate some critical mistakes they may be making in conflict resolution currently\n- Explore a feedback frame for conflict exploration or resolution",

At the end of this session, leaders will understand the following:\n- The three brains\n- The primary drivers of the head brain\n- How to create a suitable environment for the brain to thrive\n- The surprising science behind creativity\n- How to motivate individual members of the team\n- How to design feedback in a way that supports learning and growth",

Leaders should therefore be able to access various embodiments of leadership while honouring their unique personality to be effective. This module will introduce leaders to the four archetypes of leadership and their role in enabling culture and systematic approaches within the organisation. At the end of this module, leaders will:\nUnderstand the different archetypes of leadership – their commitment, behaviours, and outcomes \n- Explore the archetypes that they are most drawn to and why \n- Explore how reliance on a particular archetype creates a specific culture and systemic pattern in the organisation \n- Use icebergs to surface invisible dynamics in the organisation \n- Understand how to shift archetypes as each leadership moment presents itself\n",

Also, it was good to realize how emotions are actually not triggered but rather created by oneself. To anyone thinking of taking this masterclass, I would highly recommend it. It is transformational and brings self-awareness. Without self-awareness, one cant lead others optimally",
