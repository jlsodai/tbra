            &quot;Medical entrepreneurship is going to be more impactful on our
            future than any other industry.&quot;
          </h2>
          <p>
            The future of medical specialty development in Ghana is private. The
            top killers of Ghanaians in the productive age bracket are optimally
            treated by specialists. Medical entrepreneurship is going to be more
            impactful on our future than any other industry. I am privileged to
            contribute my quota in the fastest growing surgical specialty:
            neurosurgery.
          </p>
          <h2>
            &quot;Small, agile surgical specialty centres are the way forward,
            but philanthropic support is key to reducing financial pressures and
            advancing research.&quot;
          </h2>
          <p>
            Small, agile surgical specialty centres are the way to go for now.
            Advocacy for philanthropists who can use corporate initiative to
            fund specific disease interventions and research, reduces the
            financial burdens on these centres, freeing practitioners to hone
            their craft and to train.
          </p>
          <h2>
            &quot;Banks need to innovate and engage with specialists to
            transform healthcare into a value-generating business.&quot;
          </h2>
          <p>
            Financing medical specialty care is the biggest challenge. Banks
            must find new ways of engaging specialists to form multidisciplinary
            groups which can function as businesses, using healthcare to
            generate value.
