          <p>
            <b>Macroeconomic policies working for women and climate change:</b>{" "}
            Macroeconomic policies are not neutral to gender and are central to
            pursuing gender equality and accelerating investment in women,
            particularly in Africa.
          </p>
          <p>
            At Falémé Conseil, we have been working to ensure these policies
            (fiscal, monetary, public investments) are increasingly
            gender-responsive and we believe this centrality will continue to
            gain traction. Finance ministries and Central banks are ideally
            placed to impact a wide range of areas that can significantly
            improve the lives of women and ensure that the risk perception is
            reduced to accelerate their access to funding.
          </p>
          <p>
            But these players are also key to continue pushing for a global
            financial architecture that works for Africa, its women and climate
            change. We have been working, with others, to have these
            stakeholders increasingly looking at how economic and financial
            policies can be used to mitigate the impact of climate change,
            without jeopardising the development goals. Despite the challenges,
            we strongly believe these trends will continue gaining

            The volatile and uncertain environment created by the repeal of

            <b>Boardrooms in &quot;transition&quot; countries - a silver
            lining for directors?:</b> Transition countries (as they are referred to
            by development institutions, countries that undergo a political
            transition with sometimes far-reaching socio-economic consequences)
            challenge the boardroom.

            The volatile and uncertain environment created by the repeal of
            constitutions, laws, and other regulatory frameworks affecting
            businesses requires nimble and solid boardrooms. It requires that
            directors stay focused to address strategy, governance, and risks
            and ensure that value is created for shareholders. We have observed
            first-hand that navigating these contexts demands at least three key
            traits.
          </p>
          <p>
            First, agility to adapt to sometimes &quot;erratic&quot;
            decision-making and building relationships with new stakeholders is
            of the essence. Second, staying ahead of the curve, while being able
            to identify opportunities matters even more in these peculiar times
            of unstable legal environment. Third, soft skills and a strengthened
            support to executive teams are critical to navigate what may
            sometimes be described as irrational situations. In 2024, these will
            remain important tools for board directors exercising in these
            complex settings.

            Increasing evidence-based policymaking to deliver better public
            services in support of our economies and improve the lives of the

          </p>
          <p>
            This is crucial to avoid leading in the dark, and to increase both
            accountability and transparency. Collecting, analysing, and
            releasing more and quality data will remain seminal, while
            leveraging the digital transformation and the possibilities offered
            by artificial intelligence (AI).
          </p>
          <p>
            We have seen (and been part of) how the landscape of the data
            economy is gradually changing in Africa, with an increasing number
            of African-led/based firms. This is a positive trend that should
            enable more home-grown and context-specific solutions to overcome
            the continent&apos;s challenges and ultimately shape an African
            narrative in the domain of economics and finance.
          </p>
          <p>
            The data economy can also contribute to enhancing Africa&apos;s
            agency on the global stage. Further to this, we think that having
            more women in that space will support more inclusive and innovative
            proposals for a sweeping transformation of a public sector at the
            service of Africa&apos;s populations and its economies.
