          <p>To our stakeholders,</p>

          <p>
            Since its inception, TheBoardroom Africa (TBrA) has been dedicated
            to advocating for women&apos;s representation on boards and other
            leadership positions, driven by the stark disparity between men and
            women at the top. Over the past eight years, we have been unwavering
            in our advocacy for the inclusion of women in key leadership
            positions.
          </p>

          <p>
            By remaining adaptable, we have developed a sustainable model that
            aligns with our mission. This commitment has led to a transformative
            agenda, directly impacting the leadership journeys of thousands of
            women. We have collaborated with regional and global businesses and
            organisations to reshape their leadership spaces by placing over 200
            women on boards, investment committees, and in other leadership
            roles.
          </p>

          <p>
            Designed to help leaders navigate the complex challenges of
            today&apos;s rapidly changing world, our executive certificate
            programmes, developed by leaders for leaders, with contextual and
            practical solutions, have equipped more than 600 women leaders with
            the knowledge and skills necessary to transform their approaches to
            governance and sustainability. We&apos;ve done this all while also
            providing our members with a supportive and vibrant community of
            fellow leaders with whom they can collaborate.
          </p>

              We believe the inclusion of men in our community will make our
              impact more transformational. We also see this as a way to engage
              men broadly around conversations of inclusion and diversity - and
              truly make them part of the solution.
            </p>
          </div>

          <p>
            Today, I am writing to share an important and exciting development
            in our ongoing mission to foster inclusion in leadership. In our
            efforts to find the best, most effective ways to elevate the status
            of women leaders, we are continuously listening, learning and
            unlearning to stay relevant to our mission.
          </p>

          <p>
            We have come to the realisation that in order to make leadership
            teams diverse, we need to be equally intentional and ensure that all
            leaders, regardless of gender, are provided with the right tools and
            that our mission to enhance leadership opportunities for women is
            made richer in discourse and networks that are also diverse. We
            recognise that for women to advance in leadership, they need to be
            part of a supportive community and expand their access to men who
            hold the majority of leadership positions.
          </p>

          <p>
            To that effect, we are excited to announce that TheBoardroom Africa
            will be opening its membership to male candidates. We believe the
            inclusion of men in our community will make our impact more
            transformational, and we also see this as a way to engage men
            broadly around conversations of inclusion and diversity - and truly
            make them part of the solution.
          </p>

          <p>This change is motivated by:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Our belief that expanding our network by including influential
              male leaders will provide women members with richer expert
              networking opportunities, facilitating greater access to
              opportunity, collaboration, and learning.
            </li>
            <li>
              Our desire to hone in on diversity more broadly, to include
              diversity in age, ethnicity, and more, aligns with our belief that
              varied perspectives enrich leadership.
            </li>
            <li>
              Our vision for a collaborative society and our belief that where
              men and women work side by side, society as a whole thrives. This
              change amplifies our vision for harmonious and effective
              leadership.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            While we are opening our doors to male members, our core commitment
            to addressing gender diversity remains steadfast. Women will
            continue to be the cornerstone of our community, embodying our
            unwavering commitment to challenge and change the gender narratives
            in leadership across Africa. Alongside these changes, we plan to
            provide enhanced services and programs, including a broader talent
            base for executive search clients and richer learning experiences
            that benefit from wider perspectives.
          </p>
